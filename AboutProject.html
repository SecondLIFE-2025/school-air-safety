    <h2>Project Aim</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of this project is to develop a simple, clear, and practical
        digital system that translates air quality data into actionable school
        safety recommendations during periods of poor air quality.

    <h2>Why This Project Is Important</h2>
    <p>
        In many cities of Kazakhstan, winter air pollution is a long-term issue.
        Despite available monitoring data, this information is rarely adapted
        for school-level decision-making. As a result, students continue outdoor
        activities even during highly polluted days.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analysis of official air quality monitoring data</li>
        <li>Focus on PM2.5 as the most harmful pollutant</li>
        <li>Survey of students, parents, and school staff</li>
        <li>Comparison of environmental data with social response</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        The project is limited by a small number of survey responses and a short
        monitoring period. The system currently provides general recommendations
        rather than city-specific automated alerts.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Integration of real-time air quality data</li>
        <li>Automatic alerts for schools and parents</li>
        <li>Expansion to multiple cities and countries</li>
        <li>Mobile application version of the dashboard</li>
    </ul>
