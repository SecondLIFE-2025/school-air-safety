    <h2>Air Quality Monitoring Results</h2>
    <p>
        Atmospheric air quality was monitored near Nazarbayev University in Astana
        during a 7-day winter period. The analysis focused on carbon monoxide (CO),
        particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO₂).
    </p>

    <h2>Key Environmental Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PM2.5 concentrations exceeded safe limits on all monitored days</li>
        <li>Pollution levels remained consistently high, not episodic</li>
        <li>Carbon monoxide showed daily fluctuations linked to human activity</li>
        <li>Winter heating and traffic are dominant pollution sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survey Results: School & Public Perception</h2>
    <p>
        An online survey was conducted among students, parents, and school staff
        from different regions of Kazakhstan.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most respondents described winter air quality as poor or very poor</li>
        <li>50% reported noticing smog or pollution 1–2 times per week</li>
        <li>Coal heating and traffic were identified as main pollution sources</li>
        <li>Fatigue, headaches, and breathing difficulties were common symptoms</li>
        <li>70% stated that schools do not cancel outdoor activities during pollution</li>
        <li>80% supported the idea of a daily school air safety report</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
        The combination of monitoring data and survey responses reveals a mismatch
        between actual pollution levels and school responses. While pollution is
        persistent and severe during winter, protective measures in schools remain
        limited or unclear.
