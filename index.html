    <h2>Current Air Quality Status (Winter)</h2>
    <p class="big">HIGH PM2.5 POLLUTION</p>
    <p>
        Based on winter air quality monitoring and survey results,
        particulate matter levels frequently exceed recommended safety limits.

    <h2>Why Air Quality Matters for Schools</h2>
    <p>
        Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to air pollution.
        During polluted days, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
        increases the risk of respiratory symptoms, fatigue, headaches, and
        decreased concentration during lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite this, many schools do not have clear air quality guidelines.
        This dashboard was created to help schools, parents, and students
        make safer daily decisions during periods of poor air quality.
